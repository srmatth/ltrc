# ltrc (development version)

## 0.0.0.9008

* Added in efficient score function variance estimation to the simulation study

## 0.0.0.9007

* Edited the standard deviation of the random noise added to the beta starting values to be more robust

## 0.0.0.9006

* Fixing a previous modification to the simulation setup, and also building returning all convergences into the simulation function

## 0.0.0.9005

* Making the cross-validation a better process

## 0.0.0.9004

* Doing newton-raphson with only the diagonal elements of the information

## 0.0.0.9003

* Fixed an error in the computation of the off-diagonal elements of the information matrix

## 0.0.0.9002

* Added the ability to do a simulation for ltrc data along with only lt or only rc data, as well as just a normal linear model.

## 0.0.0.9001

* Added flexibility for the simulation function.
