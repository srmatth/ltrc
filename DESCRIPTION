Description: This package enables the fitting of semiparametric linear models on data that
  are subject to both right-censoring and left-truncation. This method is presented in the paper 
  "Regression for Left-Truncated and Right-Censored Data: A Semiparametric Sieve Likelihood Approach"
   by Spencer Matthews and Bin Nan.
